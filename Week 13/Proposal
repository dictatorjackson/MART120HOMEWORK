The project I would like to recreate is recreating a small Gif I made of my beloved dog after some bad news for him in j.son! This project would utilize functions, shapes, and loops to create a moving drawing that resembles the original work of my gif. In this folder the file is uploaded.

21st-24th - conceptualize my project, create a blueprint for how I will have to approach this, create a Hex code color guide for the colors that will be used in this project, and seek out similar projects

24th-1st - create the looping background for my project. This will be the most difficult part, so I would like to work on it first.

1st-5th - create the static image of the dog overtop of the background, and tweak the background to my liking. 

I’ve already created the color guide and started on the moving shapes for the background (though they’re not in movement yet.) Moving forward I want to figure out how to move multiple circles in the same pattern to make them appear as a single cloud. (for all of the clouds of color I need to move for this project.)
