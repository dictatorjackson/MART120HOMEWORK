CLI and GUI are both interfaces that help you navigate your machine and work with files and running commands within it, but the way they do that is completely different. Or, not completely different, but they display information in a different way. You can run commands and access files in both File Explorer (my GUI) and the Command Prompt (my CLI), but you have to be more well versed in how to “talk” to your machine, so to speak. In a GUI, things are laid out in nice, organized formats with images to correlate. It is easier for me to navigate this form of interface, but I feel as if I have more control when using a CLI. While it’s more difficult, and takes more research to know what exactly you need to “ask” your machine, you can get more freedom when using a CLI. Your machine can do a lot, whether on a Mac or Desktop, you just need to know what to input!
