Auditory: 40%

I actually think that learning styles are sort of a conspiracy. In my own research, I've learned that learning styles aren't actually indicitive of how people learn, and that most everyone does better with a combination of all learning styles. I also believe that it is super subjective based simply on what you're learning, like learning music will of course benefit from auditory stimuli, whereas reading would benefit from visual, and building something would be easier with the tactile sensations from your hands. Most of all, though, I think that people do best in a learning environment where they get the chance to do to something themselves. It is so difficult to learn something simply through a textbook or somoene explaining it to you in a lecture. As people always say, practice makes perfect, and that is so true for learning a new skill or concept. Math is difficult for me, so very difficult, but I've always strived when I have a teacher or professor who is willing to sit with me and help me while I try to figure out a concept myself. I believe that's the best way to learn, to do it with your own hands while having an expert on call to help you when you get stuck. But I'm just one person, and I won't claim to know everything, so I'm interested to see if people have vastly different opinions!
