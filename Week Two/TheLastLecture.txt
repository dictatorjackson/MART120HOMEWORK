The Last Lecture is actually a book I had to read in my senior year literature class in high school! To start off, I'll state the obvious, that book was very powerful for me; and, with a deceased parent, it was honestly a difficult read. From the entire book, I think what stuck with me most is the fact that even in his dying days he didn't let himself be bogged down. He faced every day he could with happiness, with joy, and he showed up for his family in ways even people living have trouble doing. He didn't let himself fall into a hole of self-pity, or to wallow in his fate, he just took in in stride. I think we all have a lot to learn about a growth mindset from Pausch, like how to keep showing up even if you don't want to, or to plan for the future of the things you love most even if its a future you won't see. On a personal note, it made me wish that was something my parent was able to do for me. I appreciate the vulnerability in his memoir (though it's an autobiography I suppose, it reads as his own memoir, and I think there's a beauty for that). I apologize, I'm analyzing it as if this was a literature class, when this is a coding class! Ultimately, I can appreciate the amount of real world experience that can be applied to a gorwth mindset, and how much that can then be applied to coding. Who would've thought that creative coding like this would have you also conducting an introspective on yourself and how you think...!
